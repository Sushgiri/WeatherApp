## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Java
- Framework: Spring Boot
- Architecture: Monolithic
- Databases: MySQL & MongoDB
- Other Tools: Lombok, Eureka Server, Hystrix Circuit Breaker, Swagger, Webflux, Actuator, RestApi

## Modules

### Weather Information
- Fetches and displays real-time weather updates for specified locations.
- Provides detailed information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

### User Profiles
- Manages user information, including profiles, preferences, and historical blog data.
- Provides functionalities for user authentication and authorization.

### Location-based Alerts
- Sends alerts to users for severe weather conditions based on their specified locations.
- Implements a notification system for timely and relevant weather warnings.

### Weather History
- Stores and retrieves historical weather data for analysis and comparison.
- Allows users to explore past weather patterns and trends.

### Analytics
- Implements an analytics module for monitoring blog post performance, user engagement, and trending topics.
- Generates insights to assist authors and administrators in refining content strategies.

## Application Health Check Mechanism

The application implements a health check mechanism using Spring Boot Actuator. Actuator provides insights into the Spring environment with functions for health checking and metrics gathering. The health check endpoint is exposed over HTTP and JMX.

## Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability are achieved by capturing useful health metrics from Spring Boot applications. These metrics are integrated with popular monitoring tools to predict system health by observing anomalies in metrics like memory utilization, errors, and disk space.

## Future Modules

### Forecast Predictions
- Introduces a module for weather forecasting, providing users with insights into future weather conditions.

### Satellite Imagery Integration
- Enhances the application by integrating satellite imagery for a visual representation of current weather patterns.

### Mobile Application Integration
- Develops a mobile application to extend the reach of real-time weather updates to users on the go.

## Conclusion

The Real-time Weather Update Application is your go-to solution for accurate and instant weather information. With a Spring Boot Monolithic architecture, it ensures a robust and centralized platform for seamless weather tracking. The incorporation of Spring Boot Actuator guarantees health check mechanisms, making the application observable and monitorable. The planned future modules aim to further enrich the application, offering users an enhanced experience in staying informed about the ever-changing weather conditions.
